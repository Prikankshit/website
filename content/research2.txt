International Business Specialization
Esports Specialization                  With a Computer Science degree, an MBA from Schulich, and
Student Alumni Ambassador 22-23         certifications in CSM, CSPO, and Google Data Analytics, I specialize
Certified ScrumMaster®
                                        in bridging the gap between strategy, technology, and execution. I
                                        design programs and systems that don’t just exist on paper—they
                                        get adopted, deliver measurable results, and drive real business
                                        impact.


                                        Most recently, I led an end-to-end CRM and analytics
                                        implementation (Blackbaud + Luminate Online), handling everything
                                        from needs assessment and workflow design to training, stakeholder
                                        alignment, and executive dashboards. The result? Higher
                                        engagement, reduced manual processes, and decision-grade
                                        visibility for leadership.

                                        I thrive on programs that require end-to-end ownership, technical
                                        systems thinking, and cross-functional execution. Whether it’s
                                        streamlining operations, designing workflows, or driving adoption of
                                        new tools, my goal is always the same: create sustainable impact
                                        and meaningful outcomes.


                                        I love connecting with people who are passionate about turning ideas
                                        into results—let’s explore how we can make an impact together.
